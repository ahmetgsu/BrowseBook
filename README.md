### Aim of the project

- Make an application that allows users to browse book titles. Users are able to view books in two different ways: text based data or by book cover image.
- Users may switch between two tabs, one with book text data and one with images.
- Create a native UI component (Android or iOS) that shows the book covers in a tile view.
- Users can visit `mwlbooksapp://books/{isbn}` in their browser and within the app, they see the book cover, title, and author's name (Deep linking)
